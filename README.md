# Software Configuration Management (SCM)

Software Configuration Management (SCM) is a way to keep track of changes in software projects. It helps teams work together, avoid mistakes, and manage updates smoothly.

## How GitHub Helps with SCM
GitHub makes SCM easier by:
- **Tracking changes**:  Every update is recorded, making it easy to see what changed and who made the change.
- **Collaboration**: Multiple people can work on the same project without overwriting each otherâ€™s work.
- **Reverting mistakes**: If something breaks, you can go back to a previous version. It's called version control.
- **Branching and merging**: Developers can experiment with new features in separate branches before merging them into the main project.
